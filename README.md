In order to run the assignment :-

1) Remove (basically cut it) the basics subfolder from src folder. That folder contains the files for the backend. The remaining folder should be pasted in your root directory.
2) Paste the basics subfolder in your root directory. Navigate into that directory in Command Prompt using the 'cd' command, then run npm start. The server will start up.
3) Navigate into the main project directory using 'cd' command, then run npm start. The frontend will start working.
